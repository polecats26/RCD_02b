        <p><b>Coco</b> is Dr. Rangel&apos;s furbaby, a mini poodle with big paw prints to fill. Since Koda, Dr. Chao&apos;s english labrador, passed on to the rainbow bridge, Coco has made sure to make our office full of puppy love again! He is the staff&apos;s favorite colleague and patients&apos; favorite greeter. He absolutely loves cuddles and pets, and he helps patients with their dental anxiety. Coco makes a dental visit so much better with his irresistible, adorable self. On your next visit, you might just be offered his favorite toy!</p>
