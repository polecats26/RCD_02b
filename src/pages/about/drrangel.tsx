        <p><b>Dr. Cynthia Rangel</b> is a dedicated and compassionate dentist, proudly serving the Los Angeles community  with a focus on patient-centered care. Her journey in the dental field began while she was still in high school when she started her career as a dental assistant. This early experience sparked a deep passion for dentistry, leading her to become a dental hygienist, a role she practiced for several years before deciding to further her education and expertise.</p>

        <p>Dr. Rangel graduated from the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC, where she received rigorous training in the latest dental techniques and technologies. Her extensive background as both a dental assistant and hygienist has given her a unique perspective on patient care and a profound understanding of the profession from multiple angles. Her fluency in Spanish also helps patients feel more comfortable communicating their dental needs especially for those with language barriers.</p>

        <p>Dr. Rangel believes in the power of preventative care and educating her patients about maintaining their dental and overall health. Whether it&apos;s a routine check-up, oral cancer screenings, cosmetic enhancement, or complex dental procedure, she strives to create a comfortable and positive experience for every patient.</p>

        <p>When she is not in the office, she enjoys visiting her family in the central coast, she enjoys travel, exercise, and spending time with her fur baby Coco, which accompanies her to the office.  All these things help her stay balanced and energized. Dr. Rangel is deeply committed to making a positive impact on the lives of her patients and looks forward to continuing to serve the community with integrity and excellence.</p>
